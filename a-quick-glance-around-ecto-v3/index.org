* Introduction
  This book will act as a map of large numbers of docs, and guide you to glance over the main features of Ecto v3 by trying to construct the database layer of a blogging system.

  If you want to have a deep insight of Ecto or more complicated use cases, you can read more in [[https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/][Ecto's Docs]], [[https://pragprog.com/book/wmecto/programming-ecto][Programming Ecto]] or [[https://dashbit.co/ebooks/the-little-ecto-cookbook][The Little Ecto Cookbook]].

  #+begin_question
  Why do you take a blogging system as the example?

  A blogging system is the system that everybody knows. Readers don't have to spend time to learn domain-specific things.
  #+end_question

* Prerequisites
  Before reading this book, you should know how to write basic Elixir. That's all.

* The Conventions
  Conventions reduce the effort needed to read and understand.

** Plain English
   In order to help people as much as possible, I am trying to write this book in 7th-grade plain English.

   #+begin_quote
   English isn't my mother language. When you find any error, it would be nice if you can [[mailto:c4710n@pm.me][email me]] or [[https://github.com/c4710n/the-books-of-alchemy/issues][create an issue]].
   #+end_quote

** The types of annotations
   #+begin_question
   This is a question you will ask.
   #+end_question

   #+begin_quote
   This a quote.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_note
   This a note.
   #+end_note

   #+begin_warn
   This is a warning.
   #+end_warn
** Notation of shell commands
   The shell commands is prefixed by =$= which is the default prompt for ordinary UNIX users.

   For example:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ ls -al ~
   #+end_src

** Reading official documents
   When something has been explained in official documents, it won't be described again. I will guide you to read the related documents.

   For example, when you see something like /please read =h Ecto.Schema=/, it means:
   + read docs in a terminal by typing =h Ecto.Schema= in IEx.
   + read docs in a web browser by visiting [[https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html][Ecto.Schema]].

* Setup Environments
  Before moving on, we should ensure that fundamental environments are configured:
  + Elixir 1.10+ is installed
  + PostgreSQL is installed

  There are lots of online tutorials about setting up environments, we won't describe them again.

* Sample Application
  Ecto is an Elixir library, it should be used in an Elixir project. Therefore, we should create a project before playing with Ecto.

** Creating a mix project
   Create a project called =paper=:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ mix new paper --sup
   #+end_src

   The =--sup= option is required. It ensures that the generated application has a supervision tree, which is required by Ecto.

   #+begin_note
   It's OK to run =mix new= without =--sup= option. But, you need to do more works later.
   #+end_note

** Adding dependencies
   Two packages are required:
   + =ecto_sql=
   + =postgrex= - database adapter for PostgreSQL

   Edit =mix.exs=:
   #+begin_src elixir
   defp deps do
     [
       {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.0"},
       {:postgrex, ">= 0.0.0"}
     ]
   end
   #+end_src

   Fetch dependencies:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ mix deps.get
   #+end_src

** Setting up a Repo
*** running a Mix task
   #+begin_quote
   You may be wondering what a Repo is. Now, just think it as a normal Elixir module. We will explain it later.
   #+end_quote

   Generating a Repo:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ mix ecto.gen.repo -r Paper.Repo
   #+end_src

   Above command will output:
   #+begin_src text
   ,* creating lib/paper
   ,* creating lib/paper/repo.ex
   ,* creating config/config.exs
   Don't forget to add your new repo to your supervision tree
   (typically in lib/paper/application.ex):

       {Paper.Repo, []}

   And to add it to the list of ecto repositories in your
   configuration files (so Ecto tasks work as expected):

       config :paper,
         ecto_repos: [Paper.Repo]
   #+end_src

   As you can see, it generates =lib/paper/repo.ex=:
   #+begin_src elixir
   defmodule Paper.Repo do
     use Ecto.Repo,
       otp_app: :paper,
       adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres
   end
   #+end_src

   #+begin_note
   About the options:
   + =:otp_app= option indicates the location of Ecto configuration.
   + =:adapter= option indicates the database adapter.
   #+end_note

*** adding rest configurations
   Edit =lib/paper/application.ex= for adding Repo to supervision tree:
   #+begin_src elixir
   # ...
   def start(_type, _args) do
     children = [
       # add repo to supervision tree
       {Paper.Repo, []}
     ]
     # ...
   end
   # ...
   #+end_src

    Edit =config/config.exs= for making Ecto related Mix tasks work as expected:
    #+begin_src elixir
    config :paper,
      ecto_repos: [Paper.Repo]
    #+end_src

** Creating database
   #+begin_src sh
   $ mix ecto.create
   The database for Paper.Repo has been created
   #+end_src

** (optional) Updating configurations for =mix format=
   Ecto has additional formatting rules. In order to apply these rules, following content should be added.

   Edit =.formatter.exs= for formatting general Elixir code:
   #+begin_src elixir
   # Used by "mix format"
   [
     import_deps: [:ecto],
     inputs: ["*.{ex,exs}", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}", "priv/*/seeds.exs"],
     subdirectories: ["priv/*/migrations"]
   ]
   #+end_src

   Edit =priv/repo/migrations/.formatter.exs= for formatting migrations:
   #+begin_src elixir
   [
     import_deps: [:ecto_sql],
     inputs: ["*.exs"]
   ]
   #+end_src

** Last
   Now, Ecto is ready to communicate with the database.

* Sample Data Model
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sample-data-model
  :END:

  Before writing any code, we should design a data model first.

  Our data model contains 5 tables:
  + authors
  + posts
  + tags
  + permalinks
  + comments

  Their relationships are described in following figure:
  #+caption: Entity Relationship Diagram
  [[file:./assets/4ba08274293d7631377890af10bf767a.png]]

  #+begin_note
  The one-to-one relationship between posts and permalinks isn't necessary for most case, it's preserved for demonstration only.
  #+end_note

* The Structure Of Ecto
  #+begin_quote
  Ecto's real purpose is translating Elixir concepts into a database language, which is SQL in most cases.

  -- Programming Phoenix
  #+end_quote

  Before talking about Ecto in details, we will introduce the structure of Ecto first. It let us have an overview of Ecto.

  Ecto includes 6 main modules which are separated in 2 packages:

  =ecto= package - contains the core functionalities:
  + =Repo= handles all the communications between Ecto and data store.
  + =Schema= provides DSL for mapping data source to Elixir structs.
  + =Changeset= provides functions for handling changes.
  + =Query= provides DSL for querying.
  + =Multi= controls transactions in a clean way.

  =ecto_sql= package - provides SQL-based adapters and database migrations:
  + database-specified adapters, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL.
  + =Migration= provides DSL for tracking database changes in a clean way.

  #+begin_question
  Why we just add =ecto_sql= when adding dependencies?

  Because =ecto= is the dependency of =ecto_sql=, it's OK to add =ecto_sql= alone.
  #+end_question

  #+begin_note
  When talking about =Schema=, we are not saying database, but data source. That is because =Schema= can be used to map any data source to Elixir structs, not just database tables.
  #+end_note

  We have already known the structure of Ecto. Next, we will introduce them separately.

* =Ecto.Migration=
  =Ecto.Migration= helps developers to track database changes in a clean way.

** What is a migration?
   A migration is a file includes a set of instructions which changes database structure.

** Creating migrations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: creating-migrations
   :END:
   Ecto provides a Mix task for generating a template for migrations:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ mix ecto.gen.migration <migration name>
   #+end_src

   After executing above command, a new migration file containing a module with empty =change= function will be generated in =priv/repo/migrations=.

   In relational database, there are 3 types of relationships:
   + on-to-one (1-1)
   + one-to-many (1-N)
   + many-to-many (N-N)

   As we saw in [[#sample-data-model][Sample Data Model]], we have four relationships, and they cover all types of relationships:
   + the relationship between authors and posts is one-to-many.
   + the relationship between posts and comments is one-to-many.
   + the relationship between posts and tags is many-to-many.
   + the relationship between posts and permalinks is one-to-one.

   Next, we will take the sample data model as an example, and demonstrate how to create migrations for all of these relationships.

   #+begin_note
   When creating a migration, we generally define following things:
   1. table names
   2. columns
   3. relationships
   4. default values
   5. indexes
   #+end_note

*** build relation ship between authors and posts (1-N)
    As we said above:
    + one author has many posts.
    + one post belongs to one author.

    Generate a migration file:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.gen.migration assoc_authors_posts
    #+end_src

    Edit the generated migration file:
    #+begin_src elixir
    defmodule Paper.Repo.Migrations.AssocAuthorsPosts do
      use Ecto.Migration

      def change do
        create table(:authors) do
          add :name, :varchar, null: false
          add :bio, :text

          timestamps()
        end

        create unique_index(:authors, [:name])

        create table(:posts) do
          add :author_id, references(:authors, on_delete: :nilify_all)
          add :title, :varchar, null: false
          add :body, :text, null: false

          timestamps()
        end
      end
    end
    #+end_src

    Apply the new migration:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.migrate
    #+end_src

*** build relationship between posts and permalinks (1-1)
    As we said above:
    + one post has one permalink.
    + one permalink belongs to one post.

    Generate a migration file:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.gen.migration assoc_posts_permalinks
    #+end_src

    Edit the generated migration file:
    #+begin_src elixir
    defmodule Paper.Repo.Migrations.AssocPostsPermalinks do
      use Ecto.Migration

      def change do
        create table(:permalinks) do
          add :post_id, references(:posts, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false
          add :url, :varchar, null: false

          timestamps()
        end

        create unique_index(:permalinks, [:url])
      end
    end
    #+end_src

    Apply the new migration:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.migrate
    #+end_src

*** build relationship between posts and comments (1-N)
    As we said above:
    + one post has many comments.
    + one comment belongs to one post.

    Generate a migration file:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.gen.migration assoc_posts_comments
    #+end_src

    Edit the generated migration file:
    #+begin_src elixir
    defmodule Paper.Repo.Migrations.AssocPostsComments do
      use Ecto.Migration

      def change do
        create table(:comments) do
          add :post_id, references(:posts, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false
          add :email, :varchar, null: false
          add :nickname, :varchar, null: false
          add :body, :text, null: false

          timestamps()
        end
      end
    end
    #+end_src

    Apply the new migration:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.migrate
    #+end_src

*** build relationship between posts and tags (N-N)
    As we said above:
    + one post has many tags.
    + one tag has many posts.

    Generate a migration file:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.gen.migration assoc_posts_tags
    #+end_src

    Edit the generated migration file:
    #+begin_src elixir
    defmodule Paper.Repo.Migrations.AssocPostsTags do
      use Ecto.Migration

      def change do
        create table(:tags) do
          add :name, :varchar, null: false

          timestamps()
        end

        create unique_index(:tags, [:name])

        create table(:posts_tags, primary_key: false) do
          add :post_id, references(:posts, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false
          add :tag_id, references(:tags, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false
        end

        create unique_index(:posts_tags, [:post_id, :tag_id])
        create index(:posts_tags, [:post_id])
        create index(:posts_tags, [:tag_id])
      end
    end
    #+end_src

    Apply the new migration:
    #+begin_src sh
    $ mix ecto.migrate
    #+end_src

** Applying migrations
   We have introduced how to apply migration in above sections. Read more details at:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ mix help ecto.migrate
   #+end_src

** Rolling back migrations
   Read more details at:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ mix help ecto.rollback
   #+end_src

** Available column types
   When [[#creating-migrations][creating migrations]], we have specified some column types, such as =:varchar= or =:text=. These data types supported by database can be used directly in migrations. And, data types with database-specific options can be used, too. Such as:
   + ~:"int unsigned"~
   + ~:"time without time zone"~
   + ...

   Besides, Ecto also maps primitive types to the appropriate database data types by the database adapters. Such as:
   + map =:string= to =:varchar=
   + map =:binary= to =:bytea=
   + ...

   #+begin_note
   Ecto defines the mapping at =ecto_sql= package. For PostgreSQL, the details can be found [[https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/blob/eda193965ef112cd0e8f584c58a2efa751655a3e/lib/ecto/adapters/postgres/connection.ex#L1181][here]].
   #+end_note

** Adding index
   Read more details at =h Ecto.Migration.index=.

** The options of =references=
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-options-of-references
   :END:

   =Ecto.Migration.references= have two options which should be explained here - =:on_delete= and =:on_update=.

   The official docs don't talk much about them. But, we can know the details by reading [[https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/blob/2ec71d74655cc076b6c965740a357dfe1505883a/lib/ecto/adapters/postgres/connection.ex#L1043][related source code]] and [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK][corresponding docs of PostgreSQL]].

*** the =:on_delete= option
    The =:on_delete= option specifies the behavior of referencing rows when a referenced row is deleted. Following is the available values.

    - =:delete_all= ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =ON DELETE CASCADE=
      + description: The referencing rows will be deleted.

    - =:nilify_all= ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =ON DELETE SET NULL=
      + description: The foreign key of referencing rows will be set as =NULL=.

    - =:restrict= ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =ON DELETE RESTRICT=
      + description: Prevent deletion of a referenced row.

    - =:nothing= (default behavior) ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =NO ACTION=
      + description: Do nothing. (It will cause an error when checking constrains.)

*** the =:on_update= option
    #+begin_note
    This option isn't used frequently.
    #+end_note

    The =:on_update= option specifies the behavior of referencing rows when the column of a referenced rows is updated. Following is the available values.

    - =:update_all= ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =ON UPDATE CASCADE=
      + description: The foreign key of referencing rows will be updated according to the referenced rows.

    - =:nilify_all= ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =ON UPDATE SET NULL=
      + description: The foreign key of referencing rows will be set as =NULL=.

    - =:restrict= ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =ON UPDATE RESTRICT=
      + description: Prevent update of a referenced row.

    - =:nothing= (default behavior) ::
      + PostgreSQL clause: =NO ACTION=
      + description: Do nothing. (It will cause an error when checking constrains.)

** Practices
*** ensure migrations can be rolled back
    When adding a new migration, we should ensure that we can roll them back.

    Generally, Ecto can infer the rollback behavior of =change/0= function in the migrations. When it can't, consider using =up/0= and =down/0=.

*** should I editing an existing migration?
    If the migration hasn't been commited to VCS, you are free to edit an existing one.

    If the migration has been committed and you are not the only one in the team, you'd better creating a new one.

** Resources
   + [[https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/ecto-migrations-simple-to-complex][Ecto Migrations: Simple to Complex]]

** Last
   The database is ready, it's time to insert data into it.

* =Ecto.Repo=
  =Ecto.Repo= provides basic API for communicating with database.

** The Repository Pattern
   Ecto adopts **The Repository Pattern** for accessing underlying data store. In this pattern, there's a role called Repository who controls all the communications between Ecto and data store.

   The general lifecyle of queries looks like:
   1. All the queries are submitted to the Repository.
   2. The Repository transforms the queries and send them to data store.
   3. The Repository handles the responses from data store and transforms them into easy-to-use way.

   The keypoint is **the Repository acts as a gateway of data store**. When you want to make changes to data store, talk to Repository.

** Repository in Ecto
   =Ecto.Repo= is the so-called /Repository/ in Ecto.

   But, =Ecto.Repo= isn't used directly. It should be used in a self-created module. When creating the sample application, we have created the module called =Paper.Repo=.

   #+begin_note
   For brevity, in the following sections, I will use =Repo= to represent the self-created module - =Paper.Repo=, and use =Ecto.Repo= to represent the original module.
   #+end_note

** Low level API for CRUD
   =Repo= provides low level API to complete CRUD operations directly.

   | Operation Name | Function Name                                           |
   |----------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
   | CREATE         | =Repo.insert_all=                                       |
   | READ           | =Repo.query= (an alias for ~Ecto.Adapters.SQL.query/4~) |
   | UPDATE         | =Repo.update_all=                                       |
   | DELETE         | =Repo.delete_all=                                       |

   All =*_all= functions support =:returning= option for selecting which fields to return. Read their documents for more details.

   #+begin_note
   When using =Repo.query=. you will find the return value is hard to parse. And, working with SQL directly is clumsy and unsafe (SQL injection).

   =Ecto.Query= is the better choice for queries.
   #+end_note

** Extending Repo
   =Repo= is a regular Elixir module, we can extend it as normal. It is useful when we want to:
   + encapsulate tediously long options for particular functions.
   + add functions that Ecto doesn't support currently.
   + ...

   For example, adding a counting function:
   #+begin_src elixir
   defmodule Paper.Repo do
     use Ecto.Repo,
       otp_app: :paper,
       adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres

     def count(table) do
       aggregate(table, :count, :id)
     end
   end
   #+end_src

   Call the added function:
   #+begin_src elixir
   Paper.Repo.count("authors")
   #+end_src

** Last
   Read more details at =h Ecto.Repo=.

* =Ecto.Schema=
  =Ecto.Schema= provides DSL for mapping data source to Elixir structs.

** Creating schemas
   #+begin_note
   Like creating a migration, when creating a schema, we generally define following things:
   1. table names
   2. fields
   3. associations (relationships)
   4. default values
   #+end_note

*** creating a context first
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: creating-a-context
    :END:

    A context is a concept introduced by Phoenix. It is a dedicated module that expose and group related functionality.

    Here, we will just create a context without talking much about it. If you are interested in the details of contexts, please read [[https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/contexts.html][the official docs]].

    Our context will be named as =CMS=. Now, let's create it by editing =lib/paper/cms.ex=:
    #+begin_src elixir
    defmodule Paper.CMS do
    end
    #+end_src

    So far, the context is empty, because we have no public API for this context.

*** association related macros
    =Ecto.Schema= provides following macros for indicating the associations between schemas:
    + one-to-one - =has_one= / =belongs_to=
    + one-to-many - =has_many= / =belongs_to=
    + many-to-many - =many_to_many= with =:join_through= option

    It's hard to understand them without any example. Next, we will create necessary schemas step by step. When you have questions about them, please read respective documents like =h Ecto.Schema.many_to_many=.

*** creating a schema for authors
    Edit =lib/paper/cms/author.ex=:
    #+begin_src elixir
    defmodule Paper.CMS.Author do
      use Ecto.Schema

      alias Paper.CMS.Post

      schema "authors" do
        field :name, :string
        field :bio, :string
        has_many :posts, Post

        timestamps()
      end
    end
    #+end_src

    #+begin_note
    =schema= and =field= do two things:
    1. define the mapping between schema and database.
    2. define a struct for current schema.

** Starting IEx
   We have created all required schemas, it is time to do some experiments with them.

   Before starting IEx, it is better to add configurations for it. The configurations help us type less every time we starting IEx.

   Edit =.iex.exs=:
   #+begin_src elixir
   import Ecto.Query

   alias Paper.Repo
   alias Paper.CMS.{Author, Permalink, Tag, Comment, Post}
   #+end_src

   Now, let's start it:
   #+begin_src sh
   $ iex -S mix
   #+end_src

** CRUD
*** insert
    Ecto provides following functions which can be used with schemas:
    + =Repo.insert=
    + =Repo.insert!=
    + =Repo.insert_all=
    + =Repo.insert_or_update=
    + =Repo.insert_or_update!=

**** inserting without association
     Authors and tags can be inserted without associations:
     #+begin_src elixir
     # insert authors
     %Author{name: "Spike", bio: "I have a cool name!"}  |> Repo.insert()
     %Author{name: "Julia", bio: "I have a beautiful name!"}  |> Repo.insert()
     Repo.count("authors") #=> 2

     %Tag{name: "Life"} |> Repo.insert()
     %Tag{name: "Art"} |> Repo.insert()
     %Tag{name: "Religion"} |> Repo.insert()
     Repo.count("tags") #=> 3
     #+end_src

     But, there's a problem here - the data is NOT validated before inserting to database. This means we can insert anything we want. Try to insert a piece of useless data:
     #+begin_src elixir
     %Author{name: "", bio: ""}  |> Repo.insert()
     #+end_src

     Obviously, above useless data is not what we want. If you want to validate the data before inserting to database, =Ecto.Changeset= which will be introduced later is needed.

**** inserting with associations
     Inserting with associations needs =Ecto.Changeset= which will be introduced later.

*** query
    Ecto provides following functions which can be used with schemas:
    + =Repo.all=
    + =Repo.one=
    + =Repo.one!=
    + =Repo.get=
    + =Repo.get!=
    + =Repo.get_by=
    + =Repo.get_by!=
    + ...

    Query the data we have inserted to database:
    #+begin_src elixir
    Repo.all(Author)
    Repo.get(Author, 2)
    Repo.get_by(Author, %{name: "Julia"})
    # ...
    #+end_src

    If you need build complex query, try to use =Ecto.Query= which will be introduced later.

*** update
    Ecto provides following functions which can be used with schemas:
    + =Repo.update=
    + =Repo.update!=
    + =Repo.update_all=

    Updating needs =Ecto.Changeset= which will be introduced later.

*** delete
    Ecto provides following functions which can be used with schemas:
    + =Repo.delete=
    + =Repo.delete!=
    + =Repo.delete_all=

    Delete one author:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author = Repo.get_by(Author, %{name: ""})

    case Repo.delete(author) do
      {:ok, _author} ->
        "Deleted successfully."
      {:error, _changeset} ->
        "Something went wrong."
    end
    #+end_src

** Last
   As you see, without =Ecto.Changeset=, we can't insert or update data reliably.

   Next, we will introduce =Ecto.Changeset=.

* =Ecto.Changeset=
  =Ecto.Changeset= encapsulates the whole change policy, including allowed fields, detecting changes and validations.

  In short, it defines the updating policies which make sure the database is changed safely.

** About =%Ecto.Changeset{}=
   =%Ecto.Changeset{}= is the struct holding all the changes which will be performed to the database.

   For brevity, in the following sections, I will use =%Changeset{}= instead of =%Ecto.Changeset{}=.

** Basics
   General updating process is broke up into 3 stages:
   1. casting and filtering raw data into changes
   2. validating changes
   3. sending changes to database

   #+begin_src elixir
   raw_data
   |> cast_and_filter
   |> validate_changes
   |> send_changes_to_database
   #+end_src

   Next, we will talk about each step in detail.

** Casting and Filtering
   The first step is casting and filtering the raw data, and transform it as =%Changeset{}=. In Ecto:
   + /casting/ means type conversion, like converting string to integer.
   + /filtering/ means removing unused data.

   Depending on where the data is coming from, this step can be done in two different ways.

*** handling internal data
    #+begin_quote
    Internal data is the data which is coming from application code.
    #+end_quote

    Handling internal data can be done with =Ecto.Changeset.change=.

    Create a new changeset from a new schema:
    #+begin_src elixir
    import Ecto.Changeset

    changeset = change(%Tag{name: "Music"})
    #+end_src

    Create a changeset from an existing schema:
    #+begin_src elixir
    import Ecto.Changeset

    author = %Author{name: "unknown", bio: ""}  |> Repo.insert()
    changeset = change(author)

    # add data when calling change function
    changeset = change(author, name: "Vicious")
    changeset = change(author, name: "Vicious", bio: "I have an evil name!")

    # change function can be called multiple times
    changeset = author
    |> change(name: "Vicious")
    |> change(bio: "I have a evil name!")
    #+end_src

    Read more details at =h Ecto.Changeset.change=.

*** handling external data
    #+begin_quote
    External data is the data which is coming outside of your application code, such as:
    + user forms
    + API calls
    + command line
    + CSV file
    + ...
    #+end_quote

    When working with external data, we should suppose that the data is dirty, then, *cast* and *filter* them.

    Handling external data can be done with =Ecto.Changeset.cast=.

    #+begin_src elixir
    params = %{
    "name" => "Vicious",
    "bio" => "I have an evil name!",
    "true_words" => "I want to be a good man."
    }

    changeset = cast(%Author{}, params, [:name, :bio])
    #+end_src

    Read more details at =h Ecto.Changeset.cast=.

** Validating
   After casting and filtering, we have a =%Changeset{}= which represents changes. Before sending it to database, we should also validate the changes.

   Ecto provides two kinds of utilities for validating. They perform similar functions, but differ in implementation:
   + validations
   + constraints

*** validations
    Validations are functions provided by =Ecto.Changeset=. They accept a changeset, return a changeset.

**** built-in validations
     Built-in validations are in form of =Ecto.Changeset.validate_*=.

     #+begin_src elixir
     params = %{
       "name" => "x"
     }

     changeset =
       %Author{}
       |> cast(params, [:name, :bio])
       |> validate_required([:name, :bio])
       |> validate_length(:name, min: 3, max: 50)

     changeset.valid? #=> false
     #+end_src

     When passing all the validations, =changeset.valid?= will be ~true~. Or, =changeset.valid?= will be ~false~, and the details of validation error can be found at =changeset.errors=.

**** custom validations
     Ecto provides support for custom validations in case that you need validtions which are not supported by it.

     Read more details at =h Ecto.Changeset.validate_change=.

*** constraints
    Like validations, contraints are functions provided by =Ecto.Changeset=, too. It allows developers to use underlying relational database features to maintain database integrity. Such as, preventing duplicated username in a user management system.

    They accept a changeset, return a changeset, just like validations.

    When using a constraint, you need:
    1. define database constraints
    2. catch constraint errors

    Next, we will introduce these 2 steps with =unique_constraint/3=.

    #+begin_note
    Unlike validations, constraints won't run before hitting database. Instead, they run when Ecto accepts constraint errors returned from database.
    #+end_note

    #+begin_note
    Related terminologies:
    + constraint: an explicit constraint in database level. Generally, it is defined via migrations.
    + constraint error: the =Ecto.ConstraintError=. It occurs when Ecto detecting a constraint problem issued by database.
    + changeset constraint: an annotation added to the changeset that allows Ecto to convert constraint errors into changeset error messages.
    + changeset error messages: readable error messages for users.
    #+end_note

**** defining database constraints
     Constraints are enforced by database. Because of that, they should be defined in database level.

     In order to manage database constraints, it is better to create them by using migrations. Just like we did when [[#creating-migrations][creating migrations]].
     #+begin_src elixir
     create unique_index(:authors, [:name])
     #+end_src

**** catching constraint errors
     If a constraint error isn't catched, it will be raised as =Ecto.ConstraintError=.
     #+begin_src elixir
     # create two authors with the same name, which will raise a constraint error.
     %Author{name: "Spike", bio: ""} |> Repo.insert()
     %Author{name: "Spike", bio: ""} |> Repo.insert()

     #=>
     # (Ecto.ConstraintError) constraint error when attempting to insert struct:
     #
     # - authors_name_index (unique_constraint)
     #
     # If you would like to stop this constraint violation from raising an
     # exception and instead add it as an error to your changeset, please
     # call `unique_constraint/3` on your changeset with the constraint
     # `:name` as an option.
     #
     # The changeset has not defined any constraint.
     #+end_src

     In order to catch it, an =Ecto.Changeset.*_constraint=-like function should be used:
     #+begin_src elixir
     %Author{name: "Spike", bio: ""}
     |> change()
     |> unique_constraint(:name)
     |> Repo.insert()

     #=> {:error, changeset}
     #+end_src

     As you can see,  =Ecto.ConstraintError= is catched and transformed as an error in changeset.

*** execution rules of validations and constraints
    1. execute all of valiations in order:
       1. if succeed to execute one validation, execute next validation.
       2. if failed to execute one validation, execute next validation, too. But, all of constraints will not be executed any more.
    2. execute all of constraints in order:
       1. if succeed to execute one constraint, execute another constraint.
       2. if failed to execute one constraint, the rest of constraints will not be executed any more.
*** mixins
    Mixins are functions mix the features of validations and constraints. They have following features:
    + their execution rules are same as validations.
    + they communicates with database to validating values.

    #+begin_note
    Mixin is not a terminology in Ecto. I name them in this way, personally.
    #+end_note

**** =Ecto.Changeset.unsafe_validate_unique=
     Read details at =h Ecto.Changeset.unsafe_validate_unique=.

     =Ecto.Changeset.unsafe_validate_unique= isn't a replacement of =Ecto.Changeset.unique_constraint=. It just used for providing a early feedback for users. Generally, it is used in this way:
     #+begin_src elixir
     %Author{}
     |> cast(params, [:name, :bio])
     |> validate_required(:name)
     |> unsafe_validate_unique(:name, Repo)
     |> validate_length(:name, min: 3)
     |> unique_constraint(:name)
     #+end_src
*** rendering errors
    Ecto doesn't provide solutions for rendering =changeset.errors=. When you need to render them, consider using =Ecto.Changeset.traverse_errors=.

** Sending Changes to database
   Last step, send =%Changeset{}= to database with functions provided by =Repo=, such as =Repo.insert=, =Repo.update=, etc.

** Adding updating policies for schemas
   We have known all the necessary things about =Ecto.Changeset=. It's time to write update policies for schemas.

* Filling the Context
  We have created:
  + [[#creating-a-context][an empty context]] when creating schemas.
  + schemas
  + changesets

  It's time to put them together.

  Edit =lib/paper/cms.ex=:
  #+begin_src elixir

    @doc """

  #+end_src

* =Ecto.Query=
  =Ecto.Query= provides DSL for querying. It makes querying simple and elegant.
  + =Ecto.Query= provides all available keywords.
  + =Ecto.Query.API= provides all available functions.

** Syntax
   There are two types of syntax when using =Ecto.Query=:
   + keyword syntax
   + expression syntax

   Following SQL will be wrote into above two types of syntax:
   #+begin_src sql
   SELECT a.name, a.bio FROM authors AS a
   #+end_src

*** keyword syntax
    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from a in "authors", select: [a.name, a.bio]

    Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

*** expression syntax
    #+begin_src elixir
    query = "authors" |> select([a], [a.name, a.bio])

    Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

*** How to choose syntax?
    #+begin_quote
    The syntax you choose depends on your taste and the problems you're solving:
    + keyword syntax: convenient for pulling together ad-hoc queries and solving one-off problems.
    + expression syntax: better for building an application's unique complex layered query API.

    Each syntax has its advantages.

    -- Programming Phoenix
    #+end_quote

    Personally, I think the keyword syntax is more convinient to write. Because of that, following queries will be wrote in Keyword Syntax.

** Basic usage
   A query is created and used in following steps:
   1. creating a query
   2. committing a query

*** creating a query
    When creating a query, you can use a table name string or a schema. All of them have implemented =Ecto.Queryable= protocol.

    Use a table name string:
    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from a in "authors", where: a.id == 2, select: [:name]
    #+end_src

    #+begin_note
    If not using a schema when building a query, the =:select= option is required. Or, Ecto will raise an error.
    #+end_note

    Use a schema:
    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from a in Author, where: a.id == 2
    #+end_src

*** committing a query
    Use =Repo.all=, =Repo.one= and so on for committing a query:
    #+begin_src elixir
    Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

** Debugging
   =Ecto.Adapters.SQL.to_sql/3= is used for translating a query to corresponding SQL statement. We can use these functions to help us inspect the details of queries.

   For example:
   #+begin_src elixir
   query = from a in "authors", where: a.id == 2, select: [:name]

   Ecto.Adapters.SQL.to_sql(:all, Repo, query)
   #=> {"SELECT a0.\"name\" FROM \"authors\" AS a0 WHERE (a0.\"id\" = 2)", []}

   # equal to
   Repo.to_sql(:all, query)
   #=> {"SELECT a0.\"name\" FROM \"authors\" AS a0 WHERE (a0.\"id\" = 2)", []}
   #+end_src

** Dynamic values
*** pin operator
    In Ecto, =^= (pin operator) is used for marking values or expressions that need interpolation in an Ecto query.

    #+begin_note
    =^= is named as caret in English.
    #+end_note

    When =Ecto.Query= is converted into a SQL statement, values and expressions marked by ^ will become parameterized values.

    #+begin_note
    Parameterized values provides protection against SQL-injection attacks.
    #+end_note

    An example:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author_name = "Spike"
    query = from "authors", where: [name: ^author_name], select: [:id, :name]
    Repo.all(query)
    #=> SELECT a0."id", a0."name" FROM "authors" AS a0 WHERE (a0."name" = $1) ["Spike"]
    #+end_src

*** type conversion
    #+begin_src elixir
    author_id = 2
    query = from "authors", where: [id: ^author_id], select: [:name]
    Repo.all(query)
    #=> [%{name: "Spike"}]​

    author_id = "2"
    query = from "authors", where: [id: ^author_id], select: [:name]
    Repo.all(query)
    #=> Type Error, you have to make type conversion manually.

    artist_id = "2"
    query = from "authors", where: [id: type(^author_id, :integer)], select: [:name]
    Repo.all(query)
    #=> [%{name: "Spike"}]​
    #+end_src

    #+begin_note
    =type= function is defined in =Ecto.Query.API=.
    #+end_note

    Now, type conversion seems tedious. But, after using Schema, the conversion will be done automatically.

** Query bindings
   A query binding is a variable referring to the table of the query. You can treat it as table alias in SQL.

   There are two types of bindings:
   + positional bindings
   + named bindings

   Read more details at *Composition* section in =h Ecto.Query=.

*** which one should I use?
    When a query is small, using positional bindings would be fine.

    But, when a query is large and contains joins across several tables, using positional bindings would make tracking bindings difficult. Therefore, named bindings is preferred.

** Query API
   Read =h Ecto.Query.API= for a complete list of all available API.

** Raw SQL
   #+begin_quote
   Best abstractions offer escape hatch.

   -- Programming Phoenix
   #+end_quote

   Ecto can't represent all possible queries with its own syntax, so it provides two backup plans:
   1. =Ecto.Query.API.fragment/1=: generate a SQL fragment which can be inserted into a Ecto query.
   2. =Repo.query= / =Repo.query!=: run a raw SQL with parameterized values.

   Read more details in their docs.

   #+begin_note
   Although =Ecto.Query.API.fragment/1= is a function provided by =h Ecto.Query.API=, but I still put it in this section because of their correlation.
   #+end_note

** Filtering with =where=
   =Ecto.Query= provides two macros for filtering:
   + =where=
   + =or_where=

** Combining results with unions
   When using unions, the two queries need to have result sets with the same column names and data type.

   Supported unions:
   | macro name      | description                            |
   |-----------------+----------------------------------------|
   | =union=         | remove duplicated items.               |
   | =union_all=     | don't remove duplicated items, faster. |
   | =intersect=     | remove duplicated items.               |
   | =intersect_all= | don't remove duplicated items, faster. |
   | =except=        | remove duplicated items.               |
   | =except_all=    | don't remove duplicated items, faster. |

** Ordering with =order_by=
   Read more details at =h Ecto.Query.order_by=.

   When sorting rows by multiple columns specified by =order_by=, the records will grouped and sorted by first column, then by the second column, and so on.

   When ordering, you should also notice =NULL= value. Some databases put them first, others put them last. If you want to control the order explicitly, try following options:
   + =:asc_nulls_last=
   + =:asc_nulls_first=
   + =:desc_nulls_last=
   + =:desc_nulls_first=

** Grouping with =group_by=
   When you want to filtering rows after grouping, you should use =having= and =or_having=, rather than =where= and =or_where=.

   Read more details at =h Ecto.Query.group_by=.

** Joins
   Joins are required when query acroess multiple tables at once.

   Read more details at =h Ecto.Query.join=.

** Composable Queries
   Ecto queries are composable. This feature can help us to break large queries into small reusable queries. Small queries are easy to read and maintain, which is good for us.

   #+begin_note
   The small reusable queries are composed into a query via =Ecto.Queryable= protocol.
   #+end_note

   Read more details at *Composition* section in =h Ecto.Query=.

** Using a schema
   As you see, we are using table name string in above queries. But, with a schema, we can get better experiences, because it contains:
   + the type info of fields, type conversion can be done automatically.
   + the list of fields, =:select= option isn't necessary when querying.

   Give it an example. Without a schema=, we have to do type conversion and specify the =:select= manually:
   #+begin_src elixir
   author_id = "2"
   query = from "authors",
     where: [id: type(^author_id, :integer)],
     select: [:name]

   Repo.all(query)
   #+end_src

   With a schema, query can be simpler:
   #+begin_src elixir
   author_id = "2"
   query = from Author, where: [id: ^author_id]

   Repo.all(query)
   #+end_src

** Tips
*** specifying data structure with =:select= option
    =:select= option is not only for specifying the fields returned, but also the data structure returned.

    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from a in "authors", where: a.id == 2, select: [a.name]
    Repo.all(query)
    #=> [["Spike"]]
    #+end_src

    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from a in "authors", where: a.id == 2, select: %{name: a.name}
    Repo.all(query)
    #=> [%{name: "Spike"}]
    #+end_src

    The output become a list of map now.

*** other ways to use queries
    Besides reading data, queries can be used with =Repo.*_all= functions for updating or deleting data.

    #+begin_src elixir
    from a in "authors", where: a.bio == ""
    |> Repo.update_all(set: [bio: "Hello World!"])

    from a in "authors", where: a.bio == "Hello World!"
    |> Repo.delete_all()
    #+end_src

    By using queries in this way, we can update or delete data precisely.

* Association
  #+begin_quote
  Relational Database Management System like PostgreSQL does a lot of works to help developers define and enforce the relationships between tables.

  Instead of treating the database as dumb storage, Ecto uses the strengths of the database to help keeping the data consistent.

  -- Programming Phoenix
  #+end_quote

  So far, we have talked about data without associations. Now, let's introduce data with associations.

  In this chapter, we will use the associtaion between authors and posts as the example:
  + one author has many posts.
  + one post belongs to one author.

  And, records in *authors* table are called as parent records, and records in *posts* table are called as children records.

  #+begin_question
  Q: How to distinguish parent from child?

  A: At schema level, the schema that calls =has_*= is the parent schema, the one calls =belongs_to= is the child schema. At database level, the table contains foreign key is the child table, another table is the parent table.
  #+end_question

** What is association?
   Ecto supports not only relational database, but also other types of data sources. Because of that, it's not suitable to describe the relationship between data sources by the terminology - /relationship/ which has been used in relational database.

   Association is the term which is used by Ecto to describe the relationship between data sources. You can think it as a superset of /relationship/.

** Insert / Update
   When inserting or updating records, there's two questions should be answered first:
   1. What is the type of records? parent or child?
   2. If the type is child, how many children records do you want to insert or update?

*** insert / update a parent record
    Just insert or update it, nothing to say.

*** insert a child record
    When inserting a child record, =Ecto.build_assoc= is a great choice. You pass it a parent record and the name of association. It returns a new generated child record with the foreign key setting to the parent record:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author = Repo.get_by(Author, name: "Spike")

    # bulid a new child record without filling fields
    Ecto.build_assoc(author, :posts)
    |> Repo.insert!()

    # bulid a new child record with filling fields
    Ecto.build_assoc(author, :posts, %{title: "Hello World!", body: "..."})
    |> Repo.insert!()

    # bulid a new child record with filling fields by change()
    Ecto.build_assoc(author, :posts)
    |> change(%{title: "Hello World", body: "..."})
    |> Repo.insert!()
    #+end_src

    Use =Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc=:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author = Repo.get_by(Author, name: "Spike")

    %Post{title: "Hello world", body: "..."}
    |> change()
    |> put_assoc(:author, author)
    |> Repo.insert!()
    #+end_src

    We can also set =author_id= field directly.

    Use struct:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author = Repo.get_by(Author, name: "Spike")

    %Post{title: "Hello world", body: "", author_id: author.id}
    |> Repo.insert!()
    #+end_src

    Use =Ecto.Changeset.put_change=:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author = Repo.get_by(Author, name: "Spike")

    %Post{title: "Hello world", body: ""}
    |> change()
    # It is same with =Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc=, but more verbose.
    |> put_change(:author_id, author.id)
    |> Repo.insert!()
    #+end_src

*** update a child record
    Get a record, update it with =Ecto.Changeset=.

*** handling children records as a whole
**** handling internal data
     For handling internal data, we will use =Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc=.

     =Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc= works by associating existing children records to current record.

     It takes a changeset, the name of association, and the records we want to put into the association:
     #+begin_src elixir
     Repo.get_by(Author, name: "Spike")
     |> Repo.preload(:posts) # preload is required
     |> change()
     |> put_assoc(:posts, [
       %Post{title: "Software Design", body: "..."},
       %Post{title: "Programming Ecto", body: "..."}
     ])
     |> Repo.update!()
     #+end_src

     Before making changes to existing associations, the association must be preloaded, just like above example code. But, if the parent record hasn't persisted to database, preloading association can be ignored, such as:
     #+begin_src elixir
     %Author{name: "Vicious"}
     |> change()
     |> put_assoc(:posts, [
       %Post{title: "12 Principles", body: "..."},
       %Post{title: "Software Design", body: "..."}
     ])
     |> Repo.insert!()
     #+end_src

     Read more details at =h Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc=.

**** handling external data
     For handling external data, we will use =Ecto.Changeset.cast_assoc=.

     =Ecto.Changeset.cast_assoc= works by comparing following data, and generate proper operations.
     + current children records which are preloaded from database.
     + parameters for given association which are retrieved from =changeset.params=.

     It takes a changeset, the name of association, and the optional options:
     #+begin_src elixir
     params = %{
       "posts" => [
         %{"title" => "Hello World", "body" => "..."},
         %{"title" => "Hello World", "body" => "..."}
       ]
     }

     Repo.get_by(Author, name: "Spike")
     |> Repo.preload(:posts)
     |> change()
     |> cast(params, [])
     |> cast_assoc(:posts)
     |> Repo.update!()
     #+end_src

     Read more details at =h Ecto.Changeset.cast_assoc=.

**** handling records which are replaced
     When handling children records as a whole, we should consider a question: *Which action should be applied on children records which are replaced?*

     #+begin_quote
     What is meaning of _being replaced_?

     Imagine a author has many posts where the posts has IDs 1, 2 and 3. If you call =cast_assoc/3= passing only the IDs 1 and 2. Ecto will consider 3 is being _replaced_.

     -- [[https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.4.4/Ecto.Changeset.html#module-the-on_replace-option][Official Doc of =Ecto.Changeset=]]
     #+end_quote

     =Ecto.Schema.*= provides =:on_replace= option to answer this question:
     + =has_one= has =:raise= / =:mark_as_invaild= / =:nilify= / =:update= / =:delete=.
     + =has_many= has =:raise= / =:mark_as_invaild= / =:nilify= / =:delete=.
     + =many_to_many= has  =:raise= / =:mark_as_invaild= / =:delete=.

     #+begin_note
     =:on_replace= policy is only triggered when calling =Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc= and =Ecto.Changeset.cast_assoc=. If you don't use them, it's not necessary to set this option.
     #+end_note

     #+begin_note
     No matter which =:on_replace= policy we choose, Ecto will compare /the records or parameters we passed in/ with /the persisted children records in database/.

     As we said before, Ecto doesn't support lazy loading. /the persisted children records in database/ have to be loaded manually.

     This is why we need to preload association before calling =Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc= and =Ecto.Changeset.cast_assoc=.
     #+end_note

     Read more details in the *Associations, embeds and on replace* section of =h Ecto.Changeset=.

** Query
*** load associations
    Associations must be preloaded manually.

    #+begin_note
    Ecto doesn't support lazy loading, we have to preload association manually. It helps to avoid N+1 querying problem.
    #+end_note

    Load associations when querying:
    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from Author, preload: :posts
    authors = Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

    Load associations after querying:
    #+begin_src elixir
    authors = Author
    |> Repo.all()
    |> Repo.preload(:posts)
    #+end_src

    Above two methods will query database twice regardless of the count of authors:
    + one for getting all authors
    + one for getting all posts

    If you wanna get authors and associated posts in one query, =join= can help you:
    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from a in Author,
      join: p in assoc(a, :posts),
      where: p.title == "Hello World",
      preload: [posts: p]

    Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from a in Author,
      join: p in Post,
      on: a.id == p.author_id,
      where: p.title == "Hello World",
      preload: [posts: p]

    Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

*** load associations only
    #+begin_src elixir
    author = Repo.get_by(Author, %{name: "Spike"})

    query = Ecto.assoc(author, :posts)
    Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

*** load nested associations
    #+begin_src elixir
    query = from Artist, preload: [posts: :comments]

    artists = Repo.all(query)
    #+end_src

    Ecto will return all artists with posts, and all comments in posts.

** Delete
*** delete a child record
    Get a record, delete it.

*** delete a parent record
    If a parent record has no child record, it is safe to delete it.

    But, if a parent record has children records, you have to consider a question: **which action should be applied on its children records when deleting the parent record?** [[#the-options-of-references][The =:on_delete= option of =Ecto.Migration.references=]] provides the answer to this question.

    #+begin_warn
    =has_one= / =has_many= / =many_to_many= in =Ecto.Schema= provide =:on_delete= option, too. But, you **SHOULD NEVER USE THEM**. Because these options:
    + CAN NOT guarantee database integrity.
    + only triggered by =Ecto.Repo.delete/2=, not including =Ecto.Repo.delete_all/2=.
    #+end_warn

    When the relationship between parent and child is =has_*=, and =:nothing= policy of =:on_delete= option is used, Ecto will raise an constraint error when checking constraint. If the error is valuable for users, you can catch this error by =Ecto.Changeset.no_assoc_constraint= which convert error to human-readable message. Read =h Ecto.Changeset.no_assoc_constraint= for more details.

* Seeding
  Seeding is a mechanism to populate tables with relevant data programatically.

  In Elixir, we can create a script to do this, and make sure that seed scripts is idempotent, because they may be executed multiple times.

** Handle uniqueness with upsert
   You may handling uniqueness problem in this way:
   #+begin_src elixir
   Repo.get_by(Tag, name: "Tech") || Repo.insert!(%Tag{name: "Tech"})
   #+end_src

   But, above operation is unsafe - not an atomic operation. In certain conditions, Ecto will try to insert two same data at the same time, which will cause a database constraint error.

   Instead, we shouldn't handle this uniqueness problem by ourselves. Just insert the data, and let database manage the conflict data - this feature is known as *upsert*.

   In Ecto, the *upsert* feature is implemented as =:on_conflict= option of =Repo.insert!=. A possible example would be:
   #+begin_src elixir
   # ignore conflicting data
   Repo.insert!(%Tag{name: "Tech", on_conflict: :nothing})
   #+end_src

   There are lots of available values for =:on_conflict= option, read more details at =h Repo.insert=.

   #+begin_note
   *Upsert* feature is often database specific, make sure that your database supports it before using.

   PS: Choose PostgreSQL, everything will be fine.
   #+end_note

** upsert with returning the record
   =on_conflict: :nothing= will only return the struct containing conflict fields. If you insert a tag with specified name, and want to get the tag no matter it's conflict or not, use following code:
   #+begin_src elixir
   # force update on conflict record, which returns the struct with all fields.
   Repo.insert(
     %Tag{name: name},
     on_conflict: {:replace, [:name]},
     conflict_target: :name,
     returning: true
   )
   #+end_src

** Populate data with Schema
   Data can be inserted with Schema easily, even associated data.

   #+begin_src elixir
   Repo.insert(
     %Author{
       name: "Jet",
       posts: [
         %Post{
           title: "Hello World!",
           body: "Here you go!"
         }
       ]
     }
   )
   #+end_src
* Transactions
  Ecto supports transactions through =Repo.transcation=. There are 2 ways to call this function:
  + with a function containing the operations will be run within the transaction.
  + with =Ecto.Multi=

** with a function
   #+begin_src elixir
   import Ecto.Changeset, only: [change: 2]

   Repo.transaction(fn ->
     Repo.update!(change(alice, balance: alice.balance - 10))
     Repo.update!(change(bob, balance: bob.balance + 10))
   end)
   #+end_src

   When a transaction succeeds, =Repo.transaction= returns a tuple ={:ok, return_value_of_the_function}=.

   When a transaction fails:
   + if an error is raised from the given function:
     + the transaction will be rolled back automatically.
     + the error will bubble up.
   + if no error is raised from the given function:
     + the transaction will NOT be rolled back automatically. Rollback should be specified explicitly with =Repo.rollback/1=.
     + =Repo.transaction= returns a tuple ={:error, value_specified_by_Repo_rollback}=.

** with =Ecto.Multi=
   =Ecto.Multi= groups database operations into a data structure. Compare to the plain function described above, it has some advantages:
   + you don't have to call Repo functions in the correct way carefully.
   + write less code.
   + easy to read.
   + ...

   #+begin_src elixir
   alias Ecto.Multi

   multi = Multi.new
   |> Multi.update(:from, change(alice, balance: alice.balance - 10))
   |> Multi.update(:to, change(bob, balance: bob.balance + 10))
   Repo.transaction(multi)
   #+end_src

   #+begin_note
   Always create =%Ecto.Multi{}= with =Ecto.Multi.new/0= rather than =%Ecto.Multi{}=.
   #+end_note

   When a transaction succeeds, =Repo.transaction=  returns a tuple with =:ok= and a map. The keys in the map are the unique names we provided to each operation in the Multi. The values are the return values for each of those operations. This makes it easy for us to grab the return values of any or all of the operations we ran.

   When a transaction fails and you are using changesets,  =Repo.transaction= returns a tuple with 4 items:
   + =:error=
   + the failed operation name, like above =:from= or =:to=
   + the value that caused failure
   + a map containing changes to database (the changes have been rolled back, but Ecto provides them for you to inspect)

   #+begin_note
   Ecto is designed to not waste database time. If the =Ecto.Multi= contains operations that use changesets, Ecto will make sure all the changesets are valid. If any are not, Ecto will not run a transaction at all.
   #+end_note

   When a transaction fails with an raised error:
   + the transaction will be rolled back automatically.
   + the error will bubble up.

** which one should I use?
   #+begin_quote
   If you are only running a small number of operations and don't need to take different action depending on which operation succeeds or fails, using transaction with a function is enough.

   For all other cases, you should consider =Ecto.Multi=. It has a lot more flexibility, and the code needed to respond to different types of errors will be much cleaner and easier to follow.

   -- Programming Ecto
   #+end_quote

** executing non-database operations
   Because Ecto don't know how to rollback non-database operations, you should run all of database operations first, then run non-database operations.

*** with a function
    #+begin_note
    Using =Ecto.Multi= for non-database operations is recommended.
    #+end_note

*** with =Ecto.Multi=
    Read =h Ecto.Multi.run= for more details.

** introspecting =Ecto.Multi=
   =%Ecto.Multi{}= is a data structure that can be introspected.

   Ecto team discourages inspecting or manipulating =%Ecto.Multi{}= directly, because the exact structure is subject to change.

   Ecto team provides a function to introspect operations stored in =%Ecto.Multi{}=, read more details at =Ecto.Multi.to_list/1=.

** Schema related tips
*** #1
    In Ecto, a table is not coupled to only one schema, developers are allowed to create more than one schema for a table.

*** #2
    In Ecto, a schema is not coupled to only one update policy, developers is allowed to create more than one update policies for a schema. Each update policy has its own function which is filled with functions provided by =Ecto.Changeset=.

** Adding Indexes
   Although adding indexes makes insertions become slower, but it makes queries faster. So, in general applications(more queries than writes), it is still a good idea for adding it.

   Generally, indexes are added to following columns:
   + primary keys
   + foreign keys
   + columns need to be lookup
   + columns need to be sorted
   + columns which are used with =GROUP BY=
   + ...

   By default, indexes of primary keys are created by Ecto automatically. But, indexes for foreign keys and other columns must be created by using =Ecto.Migration.index= manually.

   Common indexes:
   + unique indexes
   + sorted indexes
   + partial indexes
   + covering indexes

   + [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/indexes.html][PostgreSQL - Chapter 11. Indexes]]

** About timestamps
   By default, Ecto use =:naive_datetime=. But, I recommend using =:utc_datetime= or =:utc_datetime_usec=.

   | Migration Type         | PostgreSQL Data Type             | Elixir Type   |
   |------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------|
   | =:utc_datetime_usec=   | =timestamp without time zone=    | DateTime      |
   | =:utc_datetime=        | =timestamp without time zone(0)= | DateTime      |
   | =:naive_datetime_usec= | =timestamp without time zone=    | NaiveDateTime |
   | =:naive_datetime=      | =timestamp without time zone(0)= | NaiveDateTime |

   #+begin_question
   Q: What is the meaning of =(0)=?

   A: =(0)= means second precision. The microsecond part of timestamp is dropped.

      use Ecto.Schema

      schema "comments" do
        # ...

        timestamps(type: :utc_datetime_usec)

** Setting default value for fields?
*** set default value in database level
    Set default value for columns by using =:default= option of =add= macro in =Ecto.Migration=.

    #+begin_note
    Furthermore, the default value set in this way is used when inserting new rows, including:
    + insert new rows.
    + insert new columns for existing rows.
    #+end_note

*** set default value in application level
    There're two ways to set default value in application level:
    + use =:default= option of =field= macro in =Ecto.Schema=.
    + use =Ecto.Changeset.put_change= or similar functions.

    Default values set by =:default= option will be evaluated at compilation time, so you shouldn't use them if you need dynamic values.

    #+begin_note
    If you need dynamic values, =Ecto.Changeset.put_change= or similar functions is preferred.
    #+end_note

*** which one should I use?
    If you have multiple applications using the same database, and:
    + if they need same default values, default values can be set in schemas or migrations.
    + if they need different default values, default values should be set in schemas.

    If you only have one application, default values can be set in schemas or migrations.

    When possible, I prefer using schemas. Because in this way, I can reduce the frequency of changing database, which makes me iterate application faster.

** Commonly used constraints
   We have known the usage of =unique_constraint/3=. In this section, we will introduce other commonly used constraints.

*** =foreign_key_constraint/3=
    This function checks foreign key constraint in the given field.

    When inserting / updating a post, check if the foreign key is valid:
    #+begin_src elixir
    post
    |> change()
    |> foreign_key_constraint(:author_id)
    |> Repo.insert!()
    #+end_src

    When deleting a author, check if there's no associated post:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author
    |> change()
    |> foreign_key_constraint(
      :posts,
      name: :posts_author_id_fkey,
      message: "still exists"
    )
    |> Repo.delete!()
    #+end_src

    #+begin_note
    As you can see, using =foreign_key_contraint/3= when deleting a record, we have to define the contraint name manually. That is verbose. So I prefer using =no_assoc_constraint/3=.
    #+end_note

*** =assoc_constraint/3=
    This function checks if the associated field exists. It is generally used when inserting or updating record.

    =assoc_constraint/3= is similar to =foreign_key_constraint/3=, but field of foreign key is inferred from association definition rather than being specified exactly.

    When inserting / updating a post, check if the foreign key is valid:
    #+begin_src elixir
    post
    |> change()
    |> assoc_constraint(:author) // infer the foreign key from association name
    |> Repo.insert!()
    #+end_src

*** =no_assoc_constraint/3=
    Check the associated field doesn't exist. It is generally used when deleting record.

    Define the foreign key:
    #+begin_src elixir
    create table("posts") do
      add :author_id, references("authors")
    end
    #+end_src

    When deleting a record, ensure that no child exists:
    #+begin_src elixir
    author
    |> change()
    |> no_assoc_constraint(:posts)
    |> Repo.delete!()
    #+end_src

** Don't use constraints all the time
   #+begin_quote
   Using changeset constraints only makes sense if the error message can be something the user can take action on.

   -- Programming Ecto
   #+end_quote

   Constraints are useful when converting errors into human-readable messages. But you don't have to use them all the time.

   Give it an example.

   In our blogging system, every comment belongs to a post. If not, it can only be a bug in our application or a data-integrity issue. In such case, the user can do nothing to fix the error, so crashing is the best option. You shouldn't convert such kind of error into human-readable messages any more.
